# Solutions for the Stanford deep learning course cs231n 

The `assignment<#>` directories have the same contents as the ZIP archives from the cs231n course website. I try to to keep my completion record up to date:

- Assignment 1:
   - Q1: k-Nearest Neighbor classifier :white_check_mark:
   - Q2: Training a Support Vector Machine :white_check_mark: 
   - Q3: Implement a Softmax classifier :white_check_mark: 
   - Q4: Two-Layer Neural Network :white_check_mark:
   - Q5: Higher Level Representations: Image Features :white_check_mark:

- Assignment 2:
   - Q1: Fully-connected Neural Network :white_check_mark:
   - Q2: Batch Normalization :white_check_mark:
   - Q3: Dropout :white_check_mark:
   - Q4: Convolutional Networks
   - Q5: PyTorch / TensorFlow on CIFAR-10

## Notes
- As stated in the assignments, the solutions are either added to the Jupyter notebooks or to the Python source code. E.g. for Assignment 1, Question 1 run `assignment1/knn.ipynb` notebook and have a look at `assignment1/cs231n/classifiers/k_nearest_neighbor.py` to understand what is being computed.
