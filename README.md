# Solutions for the Stanford deep learning course cs231n 

The `assignment<#>` directories have the same contents as the ZIP archives from the cs231n course website. I try to to keep my completion record up to date:

- Assignment 1:
   - Q1: k-Nearest Neighbor classifier 
   - Q2: Training a Support Vector Machine 
   - Q3: Implement a Softmax classifier 
   - Q4: Two-Layer Neural Network :white_check_mark:
   - Q5: Higher Level Representations: Image Features 

- Assignment 2:
   - Q1: Fully-connected Neural Network
   - Q2: Batch Normalization
   - Q3: Dropout
   - Q4: Convolutional Networks
   - Q5: PyTorch / TensorFlow on CIFAR-10

## Notes
- There are some additional Python scripts, which have been automatically generated from the jupyter notebook with the same name. It was just for debugging purposes.
